## Comments on the project

### About the project

This project was delivered using Next and TypeScript with Tailwind as this is what I have been using most recently

Styling is using tailwind.

I implememted a modal to display room availability as I think this presents a cleaner search page

### Would like to haves

I must admit I didn't read the full brief and didn't implement any testing! I was considering adding some post-tests but I would need a couple or 3 hours refresher and I felt this would add too much time to the project.

I would like to have added sorting/more filters

I'm not entirely happy with the responsive design but have at least demonstrated a degree of responsiveness.

With regard to accommodation facilities I think these could be implemented as clickable tags for extra filter ability.

Could grey out any accomodation which is fully booked.
